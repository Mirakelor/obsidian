Swimming mid-stream, we struck waves to impede — that boats which passed at flying speed? .
Actually, the echoes of the wave don’t just stop in history. They became the motto that spurs us youth to strike waves in the stream of the new epoch.  
So, what are we Gen Zs doing to change the world?

I don’t wanna tell you grand stories where youngsters boost innovation and make great achievements — though these guys are quite amazing, you can find tons of these stories on TVs and newspapers.  
What I want to share with you today is a story just happening beside me — an ongoing story whose protagonist is my cousin.

Last year, my cousin graduated from a business college, returned to the hometown, and dedicated herself to achieving mutual prosperity.  
She, along with her teammates, sparked with the idea to promote the sales of Chinese bayberry — or *Yangmei* in Chinese — a specialty fruit unique to my hometown — in order to stimulate the local economy.  
However, their initial plan to sell Chinese bayberry using digital technologies and online shopping platforms ended up in stagnation, due to the challenge to transport such delicate fruit.  
Upset yet unbendable, my cousin cast her eyes on folk arts, and her multi-culture mindset instructed her to quest for solutions in diverse cultures.  
Finally, Indian *rangoli* caught her eye. Inspired, she organized a campaign where traditional Chinese painting art met bayberry juice.  
When the purple berry juice was splashed on the white Xuan paper, the picturesque landscapes of my hometown were vividly epitomized under the brush of the masters.  
Guess what? The campaign went viral on social media and turned out a great success. Foodies across the country flocked in, and sales of Chinese bayberry skyrocketed.

Now, can you see?  
With innovation and cross-culture vision, the youth today are not jumping on the bandwagon — instead, we are leading the tide, we are striking the wave, we are ready to navigate an interconnected world.

Thanks for listening.
